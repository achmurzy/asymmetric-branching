Filling the manuscript:

Start with Subtree regressions- done
Show distribution of tree tip count regressions - done
Show distribution of tree volume count regressions - done
Show as one plot, show deviation in branching trait exponent results - done
Show that branching traits still broadly agree with theory - done

*needs new analyses below here*
Quantify tip variability and relate to volume scaling results, show how tip volume scales with tip count to account for discrepancy

Relate variability in scaling exponents to life history characteristics, align with prior work
	-Result: Architectural traits ordinate alone, separate from LES/allocation traits. May be related to size
	-Add measured terminal element dimensions

New analyses:

Test Corner's Rules using terminal elements as measures of leaf size
Dive into branch angle data, add to ordinations for life history information
	-Relationship to tip size (variability) and branch length, branch diameter and wood density - Corner's Rule #1
	-As tip size (variability) increases, Corner predicts lengths will increase, diameter will increase, and wood density will decrease
	-So, terminal volume should be related to terminal beta/gamma, and wood density
